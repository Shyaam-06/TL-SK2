**5G Signal Integrity in Urban Base Stations**

---

### 1. Introduction

The deployment of 5G infrastructure in densely populated urban areas introduces complex challenges related to signal integrity. Base stations, often installed on rooftops or utility poles, must deliver high-frequency signals (in the mmWave and sub-6 GHz bands) to user equipment (UE) with minimal distortion. These frequencies, while offering high bandwidth, are highly susceptible to **attenuation**, **multipath interference**, and **signal degradation** due to environmental obstructions such as buildings, vehicles, and vegetation.

This report analyzes the signal integrity issues encountered in urban 5G base station deployments, focusing on **transmission losses**, **reflection**, **phase distortion**, and **material penetration**. A special emphasis is placed on **PCB trace design**, **cable losses**, and **free-space propagation** in real-world urban scenarios.

### 2. Problem Statement

A 5G base station operating at **28 GHz** is installed on a 10-story building and connected to its antenna array via a **2-meter semi-rigid coaxial cable**. The goal is to deliver at least **80% of the original signal power** to the antenna, with minimal reflections and phase delay.

| Component           | Type                           | Parameters                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Cable Type          | Semi-Rigid Coax (e.g., UT-085) | Attenuation: 0.35 dB/m @ 28 GHz        |
| PCB Trace           | Microstrip                     | Dielectric constant (εr): 3.5          |
| Free Space Path     | LOS Urban Air                  | Free-space loss, reflection from glass |
| Operating Frequency | -                              | 28 GHz                                 |
| Cable Length        | -                              | 2 meters                               |
| Microstrip Length   | -                              | 15 cm                                  |

### 4. Numerical Examples

#### **Example 1: Cable Signal Attenuation**

**Given:**

* Attenuation = 0.35 dB/m
* Length = 2 m
* Input voltage = 1 V

**Total Attenuation:**

$$
\alpha_{total} = 0.35 \times 2 = 0.7 \text{ dB}
$$

$$
V_{out} = 1 \times 10^{-0.7/20} \approx 0.92 \, V
$$

**Conclusion:** Signal amplitude drops to **92%**, acceptable under the 80% threshold.

---

#### **Example 2: Microstrip Delay and Loss**

**Given:**

* Microstrip εr = 3.5
* Trace length = 15 cm
* Speed of light $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s

$$
v = \frac{c}{\sqrt{ε_r}} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{\sqrt{3.5}} \approx 1.6 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
$$

$$
t = \frac{0.15}{1.6 \times 10^8} \approx 937.5 \, \text{ps}
$$

**Conclusion:** Nearly 1 ns delay from PCB trace — critical for time-sensitive beamforming.

---

#### **Example 3: Free-Space Path Loss (FSPL)**

**Distance to UE:** 200 m
**Frequency:** 28 GHz

$$
\text{FSPL (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(d) + 20 \log_{10}(f) + 32.44
$$

$$
= 20 \log_{10}(200) + 20 \log_{10}(28000) + 32.44 \approx 46.02 + 88.94 + 32.44 = 167.4 \text{ dB}
$$

**Conclusion:** Severe loss over urban distances — highlights need for directional antennas and beamforming.

---

#### **Example 4: Reflection from Building Glass**

**Assuming glass εr = 5.5**
Normal incidence

$$
\Gamma = \frac{\sqrt{ε_r} - 1}{\sqrt{ε_r} + 1} = \frac{2.35 - 1}{2.35 + 1} = 0.403
$$

$$
\text{Reflected Power} = |\Gamma|^2 = (0.403)^2 \approx 16.2\%
$$

**Conclusion:** 16% power lost to reflection at window — must be accounted for in urban design.

### 5. Recommendations

1. **Use of Low-Loss Cables:**

   * Replace standard cables with **low-loss PTFE coax** (e.g., UT-141) to reduce insertion loss.

2. **Impedance Matching:**

   * Ensure all transmission line interfaces (cable-connector, PCB-antenna) are matched to **50 Ω**.

3. **Environmental Optimization:**

   * Deploy mmWave arrays with beamforming to compensate for FSPL and urban reflections.
   * Use **anti-reflective coatings** on nearby structures or choose installation sites with fewer reflective surfaces.

4. **Thermal Stability:**

   * Use **temperature-compensated materials** in PCBs to minimize dielectric drift and phase distortion.

### 6. Conclusion

5G base stations in urban environments face significant signal integrity challenges, especially in the mmWave spectrum. Losses from transmission lines, microstrip delays, and environmental reflections can compound to degrade signal quality. Through careful selection of transmission media, impedance control, and environmental adaptation, these issues can be mitigated, ensuring high-performance 5G connectivity in cities.
